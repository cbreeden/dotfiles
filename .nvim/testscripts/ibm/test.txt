This is some text to practice on.

this is some more text to practice.  I'm trying to figure out motion commands.  There are generally 3 commands that I will use most often:

        - c : change
        - y : yank (copy)
        - d : delete

Let's practice some of those now.

exmpales:

        - yw : yank word
        - yW : yank WORD
        - yip : yank paragragh
